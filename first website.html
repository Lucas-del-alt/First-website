<h1>Lucas Ortiz Molina</h1>

<p>I was born and raised in Vancouver, although my parents immigrated here from Argentina for their university education. I live with a family of 4 including a dog named Raffi. I attended UHILL elementary school until grade five, when I moved to Dunbar and transfered to Lord Kitchener for grade six and seven.</p> 

<p>I have been playing soccer competitively for 3 years now and I am currently playing at the metro level for Vancouver United. I also have been practicing martial arts for 10 years, as currently I am a second degree black belt.</p>
